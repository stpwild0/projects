 

You are allowed to use only the basic LISP constructs: 'car', 'cdr', 'cons', and 'cond', the basic predicates: ('null?', 'eq?', 'equal?', 'atom?', and 'cons?'), the arithmetic operators: ('+', '-', '*', and '/'), and the relational operators: ('=', '<', '>', '>=', '<=', '!=') discussed in the class. You have to write your own code for any other functions that you use in the program.  When in doubtâ€¦ send me a message.
